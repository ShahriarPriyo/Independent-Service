                <p>As we are slowly walking towards the end of the course, we need to ensure proper practice of every module. After a long and hard working 6 months long course , I can realize my changes.But this is not the end. I need to continue my hard work and reach a specific goal to achieve success. In next 3 month, I want to see myself as a well prepared web developer who can cope up with any situation.</p>
